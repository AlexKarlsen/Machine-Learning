I have gained a lot of experience with a practical machine learning challenge. I used the pair-wise information in the data set to optimize model accuracy to a $0.92$ validation accuracy and $\approx 0.86$ test accuracy on the Kaggle Challenge's test set. I struggled with deep learning performance and did not have the resources to overcome the challenges.
